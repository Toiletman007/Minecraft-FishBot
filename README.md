Minecraft fishing bot in python

I made this minecraft fish bot as my first project in python so be nice :D
Also, big thanks to [Kostahe](https://github.com/Kostahe) for help with some issues along the way.

GUI:
For the GUI I used custom tkinter because i think it's a bit better then tkinter.

How it works is that you input the ammount of fish you want to fish out, and the bot will do it for you, after you save the input and click the start button.

It will automaticaly click back to game for you and automatically start casting the rod however you do have to have subtitles in english turned on and you do have to have your fishing rod in hand aimed at the water. Also pyauto gui aka the libary responsible for key strokes does not support second or third monitors so if you want this to work you have to have it open on your first monitor.
Here's a video of it in action: https://github.com/Toiletman007/Minecraft-FishBot/assets/138164750/ac5470b9-5957-4744-b14f-17d2426e1310

If you want to download, it just download ToiletsFishBot.rar, after you unzip it theres a .exe in there.
