Minecraft fishing bot in python

I made this minecraft fish bot as my first project in python so be nice :D
Sorry that the repo is so scuffed i didn't want to loose the activity and if u look at my other repos i know how to share a project on github so don't tell me about it i know this is an incredibly stupid repo.
Also, big thanks to [Kostahe](https://github.com/Kostahe) for help with some issues along the way.

GUI:
For the GUI I used custom Tkinter because i think it's a bit better then Tkinter.

How it works is that you input the ammount of fish you want to fish out, and the bot will do it for you, after you save the input and click the start button it will show you how many fish it has fished out so far and how many fish it's gonna fish out in total.

It will automaticaly click back to game for you and automatically start casting the rod however you do have to have subtitles in english turned on and you do have to have your fishing rod in hand aimed at the water. Also pyauto gui aka the libary responsible for key strokes does not support second or third monitors so if you want this to work you have to have it open on your first monitor.
Here's a video of it in action:
